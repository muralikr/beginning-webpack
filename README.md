# Beginner's Guide to Webpack Repo

> This tutorial uses Babel 6

#### This goes along with the medium post [Beginner's Guide to Webpack](https://medium.com/@dabit3/beginner-s-guide-to-webpack-b1f1a3638460)

##### To get started with this project, do the following:

1. Git clone the project
2. cd into the project
3. run 'npm install' from the terminal
4. run 'grunt' to generate bundle using `grunt-webpack`

### This repo is created to reproduce issue reported [here](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/5695)

After `webpack:dev` task, if we add any async task with some delay (`wait` in this example), Webpack rebuilds multiple times due to `fileModified` events generated by Node file watcher. Since we are creating `generated_file.js` just before `webpack` task, this shouldn't happen.

This rebuilding happens more than 15-20 times or for a duration of 10 seconds. This happens only with `watch` mode, else webpack won't be listening for file watch events.

If we add any async task (`wait` in this example) between file generation and `webpack`, then this issue won't happen. This is because all `fileModified` events are debounced and `webpack` acts on final event only.

### Environment:

* node -- v6.10.0
* webpack -- 3.6.0
* grunt-webpack -- 3.0.2
* Mac OSX Sierra
